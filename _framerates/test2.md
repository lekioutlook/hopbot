Brussels has no shortage of bars and pubs where one can enjoy some traditional Belgian beers. There's no need for any guides or maps to find a quiet place to enjoy a brew with locals.

Strolling around on the cobblestone covered streets we have stumbled upont theÂ **Au Bon Vieux Temps** bar near Saint Niclas church. The bar itself is like a cathedral to beer complete with chandaliers and stained glass windows.

Short of drinking a beer in an actual monastery this is the best way to enjoy an abbey ale.
