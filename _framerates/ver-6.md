For an upcoming interview I've visited the M47 business park in the Kőbánya district of Budapest. This building used to be be one of the biggest breweries in the country. The Fővárosi Serfőzde opened it's gate in 1902 but later was bought by one of the neighbouring breweries owned by the Dreher family.


The Dreher brewery still operates a stone throw's away and after some twists and turns this site also produces beer now.


The brewery in the socialist era became a food canning factory but in the last couple of years several small breweries started to operate at 47 Maglódi Way.


The buildings are jaw dropping monuments to the rapid industrialization of the area back in the early XX. century and it is a pleasure that finally beer brewing is making a comeback.
