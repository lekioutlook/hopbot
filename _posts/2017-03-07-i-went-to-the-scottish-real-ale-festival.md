This actually happened a good two weeks ago, when I was visiting my good old friend Norbi. He’ not only the author of the major [Hungarian Whisky Blog](https://scotchwhiskyblog.wordpress.com/)This actually happened a good two weeks ago, when I was visiting my good old friend Norbi. He’ not only the author of the major Hungarian Whisky Blog but also one of the most knowledgeable bartenders in Edinburgh.  So obviously we went out to drink something.

Quite happy coincidence that two interesting beer events were held the same time. As a sort of pre lash to the Scottish Real Ale Festival we managed to get our hands on a couple of tickets for the launch party of the much anticipated beer, the Mutiny on the Beagle by Natural Selection Brewing held on the 9th July.

National Selection is a group of ever changing students who’s task is to create and market a new beer every year. This year it was an all British IPA. The beer was served from both cask, keg and bottles. I managed to try the cask and the keg and I have to say I’m quite partial to the cask. It’s more complex and also gives back more real British ale vibe.

Then the next day we headed to the Corn Exchange, and we managed to get there right when the gates opened. This meant we had time to see what’s available and quickly bought a couple of halfs from the beers we suspected will run out quickly.

I know CAMRA had a fallout with Brewdog over their serving practices but it was a bit sad to be in the Scottish capital’s prime beer event without the most known craft brewery represented. Whereas Brewmeister beers were available, from a brewery who apparently falsified ABV data and scammed customers. I think CAMRA needs to think about this.

Otherwise the venue was great, organizers even provided an outside seating area, and because the weather was surprisingly good, that’s where we spent most of the time.

The selection was superb, a lot of interesting brews come out of Scotland lately, probably thanks to the programs similar to Natural Selection. I had mostly some refreshing pale ales and bitters due to the weather, but I have to mention the Ola Dubh 12 Year Special Reserve from Harviestoun Brewery which made a lasting impression in me. Very complex taste, sweet and bitter and you can taste the wood it was matured in. That said this beer deserves a special occasion.

I will always remember the  Lapsang Souchong Tea Pot by Tin Pot too, but not in the good way. It tasted like BBQ sauce. This is the only thing i can remember about it. But this is what beer festivals are for, try beers you wouldn’t otherwise.

Edinburgh, I’ll be back.
