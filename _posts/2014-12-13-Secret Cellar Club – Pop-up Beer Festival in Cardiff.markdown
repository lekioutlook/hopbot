<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t looks like the age of the speakesay is back, but this time it’s serving alcohol across the pond and only for a day!</p> I just received a tweet, that for one day only on 3rd August, the Secret Cellar Club will open in an undisclosed location in Cardiff where local and unique cask ales will be served. Not much is known, but I’ll be there and report about the impromptu beer fest.

To get on the guest list either register for free or purchase an advanced ticket which includes drink vouchers and chance to win some beer related goodies. Visit the Secret Cellar Club website for more info or follow @PopUpBeer on twitter
