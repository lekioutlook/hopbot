intro: SOme breweries are expanding to the US while some others to Europe but there's very little knowledge about what really goes on in Europe.

Times have changed and so have I. It has been a couple of years since I abandoned beer blogging in the pursuit of a carreer. However I never stopped drinking beer and my professional path opened up new doors for me that I might be able to open further ajar and document it in the process.

In  a nutshell I'm back in continental Europe whereas Britain seems to be moviong out of it. A lot has changed here since I left, a lot of new breweries, pubs and bottleshops sprung up in the **N**_th_ wave of craft beer revolution. The only thing that seems to be stagnating is the reporting on the business in Europe. 

Staz tuned for craft beer business news, release information and for general beer nerd content.
