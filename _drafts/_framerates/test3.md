I try not to read the labels before writing a review, so I’m no way influenced by the marketing team. Didn’t really work this time I had a glimpse of the label and now I’m unsure whether I can really taste gooseberries or I’m just imagining it.  

The Sandra is a well balanced beer, good carbonation, nice thick head, on the nose some malts, plum are quite noticeable. Tasewise As I mentioned I’d say gooseberry, redcurrant followed by a bit of roasted chestnut chocolate flavor. I can also feel a bit of floral aroma when I exhale but it’s masked by roastiness of the beer. If the alcohol content would be a bit lower I would call this sessionable.
